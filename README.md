### In React, when you use useEffect with an empty dependency array ([]), the function inside the return is called when the component unmounts.

```
useEffect(() => {
// Runs once after initial render

    return () => {
    // Runs once when the component is unmounted
    // this can be used to cleanup canvas
    }

}, [])

```
